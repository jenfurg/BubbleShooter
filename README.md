 5/23: Leo wrote some constructors and some skeletons of functions for the Game, Bubble, and Shooter classes.
 
 5/24: Leo wrote function to advance a row of bubbles and to check for game over (untested). Jennifer created the vector, worked on the designs of the background. 
 
 5/25: Jennifer worked on the the vector, trying to limit its movement and working out a shooting function. 
 
 5/26: Leo rewrote the shooter display to be a constant length in the direction of the mouse.

 5/27: Leo made initial 50ish bubbles show up upon setup and fixed colors.
 
 5/28: Leo made the shooter smoothly fire a bubble in the direction of the mouse.

 5/29: Leo made bubbles stop after hitting the edge or other bubbles, although they do not smoothly fit into a grid yet.
 
 5/30: Leo made the bubbles snap to grid after having landed. Jennifer worked on the speed at which the shooter would shoot the bubble. 

 5/31: Leo worked on making bubble shooting screen appear within a larger (currently empty) screen. Jennifer worked on the formatting of the bubble shooter to emulate the real game, started to work on adding buttons, "pause", "play", etc. 

 6/1: Leo made bubbles pop if in chains of three or more. Jennifer worked on fixing the buttons, making sure that mouseX and mouseY wouldn't be affected if the buttons were clicked + created a "How To Play" image for pop-up.
